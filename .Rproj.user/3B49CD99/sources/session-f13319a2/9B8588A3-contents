# Introduction
This paper includes a look at marriages from 2011 to 2024.
We use @alexander2021, @R-base,@R-opendatatoronto, and @toronto-open-data.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data, @sec-results, @sec-discussion, and @sec-references


# Data {#sec-data}
Our data is of marriages in the span of 13 years (@fig-bills), from @toronto-open-data.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)

# Load the data
cleaned_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Ensure the date column is in Date format before extracting the year
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>%  # Convert to Date format if it's not already
  mutate(year = year(date))  # Extract the year

# Summarize data: Total number of licenses issued per year
yearly_totals <- cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total_licenses = sum(licenses_issued, na.rm = TRUE))

# Create the bar plot with year on the x-axis and total licenses on the y-axis
ggplot(yearly_totals, aes(x = factor(year), y = total_licenses)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", alpha = 0.8, fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +  # Apply the minimal theme
  labs(title = "Total Marriage Licenses Issued by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Number of Licenses Issued")
```

# Results {#sec-results}

Our results can be seen in @fig-bills

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

Our results show that there is a disturbance of marriage licenses during the pandemic.

For data analysis, we used R [@R-base] and the `opendatatoronto` package [@R-opendatatoronto]. The data is available from the City of Toronto Open Data [@toronto-open-data], and the research structure is based on the starter repository by Rohan Alexander [@alexander2021].
