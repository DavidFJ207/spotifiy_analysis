# Introduction
This paper provides an analysis of music using the Spotify API. In this analysis, we examine three singers: Coldplay, Radiohead and The National. By utilizing Spotifyâ€™s extensive database of music and the Spotify API, we analysis three key audio features: Energy, danceability and loudness, which provide quantitative insights into the musical characteristics of each band. Overall, 

# Data {#sec-data}
For each artist, audio features of their tracks were downloaded, including `danceability`, `energy`, `valence`, and track duration.

For data analysis, we used R [@R-base] and the `spotifyr` package [@spotifyr]. The data was obtained through the Spotify API [@spotify-api], and the analysis follows standard practices in music data analysis [@music-data-analysis].
