# Introduction
This paper provides an analysis of music using the Spotify API [@spotify-api]. In this analysis, we examine three singers: Coldplay, Radiohead and The National. By utilizing Spotify’s extensive database of music and the Spotify API, we analysis three key audio features: Energy, danceability and loudness, which provide quantitative insights into the musical characteristics of each band. Coldplay, Radiohead, and The National differ slightly in musical style: The National shows higher danceability, while Coldplay has greater energy and loudness than Radiohead.  

# Data {#sec-data}
For each artist, audio features of their tracks were downloaded from Spotify API [@spotify-api], including `danceability`, `energy`, and `loudness`. `Danceability` refers to how suitable the audio is for dancing using elements sushc as tempo, rhythm, and beat strength. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. `Energy` takes into account dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy on a scale of 0.0 to 0.1 where energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. `Loudness` refers to overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB) typically between -60 and 0 db.

## Trends {#sec-trends} 
As band's loudness increases and their energy decreases, we see that the overall danceability increases. 

## Implications {#sec-implications}
The data highlights subtle but meaningful differences in the musical styles of Coldplay, Radiohead, and The National. **Coldplay**’s higher energy and loudness suggest a more mainstream, dynamic appeal, consistent with their stadium-filling sound and pop-rock influence. **Radiohead**'s lower energy and loudness reflect their more introspective, experimental approach, often favoring atmospheric, complex compositions over immediacy. **The National**'s higher danceability, combined with moderate energy and lower loudness, suggests a smoother, emotionally resonant style, balancing accessibility with depth. These variations imply how each band resonates with their respective audiences, shaping listener experiences through distinct blends of energy, mood, and engagement.
